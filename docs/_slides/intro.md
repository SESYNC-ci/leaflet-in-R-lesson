## Introduction

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a powerful open-source Javascript library that powers interactive maps on the web. This lesson provides an overview of using `leaflet`, the namesake package in R, to create ["slippy"](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map) web maps from R and integrate them into RShiny apps. 

Like static plotting and mapping, there are lots of options for interactive mapping in R. The `leaflet` package is actively maintained by RStudio. Some other packages for interactive maps that build off of leaflet, or other interactive plotting libraries, are: `tmap`, `ggiraph`, `rbokeh`, `plotly`, `highcharter`, `mapedit`, `mapview`, `leaflet.extras`, and `leaflet.esri`.
