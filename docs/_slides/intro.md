## Goals

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a powerful opensource Javascript library that powers interactive maps on the web. This lesson provides an overview of using `leaflet`, the namesake package in R to create ["slippy"](https://www.planet.com/docs/guides/slippy-maps/) interactive maps, and how to integrate them into RShiny apps. 

Like static plotting and mapping, there lots of options for interactive mapping in R. The `leaflet` package is actively maintained by RStudio. Some other packages that build off of leaflet, or other interactive plotting libraries, are: `tmap`, `ggiraph`, `rbokeh`, `plotly`, `highcharter`, `mapedit`, `mapview`, `leaflet.extras`, and `leaflet.esri`.
