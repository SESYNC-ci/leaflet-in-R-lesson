## Leaflet in Shiny

Shiny is a web application framework for R that allows you to create interactive web apps without requiring knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 

===

These web apps can be used for exploratory data analysis and visualization, to facilitate remote collaboration, share maps, and [much more](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).  
Incorporating leaflet maps into Shiny applications allows for creating more customized interactivity using R code.

===

As you may have learned in the [Shiny lesson](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/basic-Shiny-lesson/#/slides/files), the app comprises a *user interface* object that defines how it appears, and a *server* object that defines how it behaves. 

===

The ui and server interact through `*input` and `*output` objects such as input widgets, plots, buttons, tables, etc.

![shinyarrows]({% include asset.html path="images/shiny-arrows.png" %})

The example below represents a basic Shiny app. 
```{r leaflet_shiny1, handout = 2, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

# Define the user interface
ui <- navbarPage(title = 'Hello, Shiny World!')

# define the server component
server <- function(input, output){}

# Create the app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
We start by defining the ui. In this case, we use the `navbarPage()` function to define a navigation bar object to display the *"Hello, Shiny World!"* text. 
Next we define the server component, a custom function that specifies the behavior of the app. The server function takes in two parameters, an input and an output. In the example above, the server function is currently empty, so our app doesn't do anything, but we will cover this shortly.

Leaflet maps in Shiny are constructed with `renderLeaflet()` and displayed in the output using `leafletOutput()`.

To see how all of this works, we'll build a shiny app with a leaflet map, where one of the map layers is defined with a user-specified value from an input widget. See the app in action [here](https://shiny.sesync.org/apps/leaflet-in-R-shinydemo1/). 

Define an output object called `map` in the server function. 

```{r leaflet_shiny2, handout = 2, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # renderLeaflet created the map widget for the app 
  output$map <- renderLeaflet({
    # leaflet map is defined here with tiles, initial view, and layer control options
    leaflet() %>%
      addTiles(group = "OSM") %>%
      addProviderTiles(providers$NASAGIBS.ModisTerraTrueColorCR, group = "Modis",
                       options = providerTileOptions(time = "2018-01-05")) %>%
      setView(lng = -76.505206, lat = 38.9767231, zoom = 7) %>%
      addLayersControl(baseGroups = c("Modis", "OSM"),
                       options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
      )
  })
  
}
```

We wrap the leaflet map inside the `renderLeaflet()` function, using curly brackets `{}` around the expression.
We include two tile layers, OpenStreetMap and MODIS imagery, with `addLayersControl` activated to 
allow the user to select which one to display.
`output$map` is assigned the map widget for the app rendered by the `renderLeaflet` function.
{:.notes}

Define the ui to include the output called `"map"`. 

```{r leaflet_shiny3, handout = 2, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  leafletOutput("map", height = 800)
)
```

Remember, the ui is the page that humans interact with. In this case, it is a fluid page containing the map. We include the output of the `leafletOutput()` function, the map rendered in the server function, and add it to the apps page. 
A `fluidPage()` is a browser window where the contents scale up or down as the window size is changed. 
{:.notes}

===

Add a panel to the ui that will let users choose a calendar date. 

```{r leaflet_shiny4, handout = 2, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
    leafletOutput("map", height = 800),
      # add calendar panel
      absolutePanel(top = 100, right = 10, draggable = TRUE,
              dateInput("dateinput", "Imagery Date", value = "2018-03-28"
                    )
))
```

We have the map and now we add a calendar panel to let the user pick a date. We use `dateInput()` to define the panel type and set the panel position with the `absolutePanel()` function. You'll notice that we have defined the an input id, a label, and a initial value for the panel widget inside the `dateInput() `function. The input id will be used to access the value, date, set by the user in the `server` function. The
next argument, label, is the descriptive title seen by the user, and the `value` 
argument is the starting value before user input.
{:.notes}

===

Use the `dateinput` input object in the Provider Tiles layer.

```{r leaflet_shiny5, handout = 2, eval = FALSE}
 addProviderTiles(providers$NASAGIBS.ModisTerraTrueColorCR, group = "Modis",
                       options = providerTileOptions(time = input$dateinput))
```

Now, the MODIS tiles will be retrieved for a user-input day specified by
`providerTileOptions()`. The MODIS tile provider accepts an option called
`time` to which we pass the `dateinput` object from the list called `input`
that the server function gets from the ui.

===

Display your app.

```{r leaflet_shiny6, handout = 2, eval = FALSE}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

A new window with your leaflet map app will be launched. The `shinyApp()` function creates a Shiny app from an ui/server pair.

We now are able to publish your map via a Shiny app!
However, the app is hosted locally and can only be viewed on your local machine. 

--- 
To share your map and Shiny app with others, first make sure everything the app needs to run (data and packages) is loaded into the R session. 

You can share your Shiny app as files. This is limited and requires users to have R installed on their computers.

* Directly share the source code (app.R, or ui.R and server.R) along with all required data files. 
  * Your app user can place the files into a local directory.
  * They can launch the app in R by running `runApp("appFolderName")`
~~~r
library(shiny)
runApp("coolApp")
~~~

* Publish the files to a GitHub repository, and advertise that your app can be cloned and run with `runGitHub('<USERNAME>/<REPO>')`
  * Create a directory for your app
  * Share directory with app users and instruct to clone it
  * Run app with `runGitHub()`
~~~r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("<USERNAME>/<REPO>")
~~~

---

You can share your Shiny app as a web page. This is the preferred way to share Shiny apps since users do not need to have R installed on their computers.

To share just the UI (i.e. the web page), your app will need to be hosted by a server able to run the R code that powers the app while also acting as a public web server. There is limited free hosting available through RStudio with [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io).
