## Publish a Leaflet Map

If you prefer not to use Shiny, you can render a map using HTML!

Using leaflet create a map for the north east United States and add a weather data tile. 
```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)

map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = -76.505206, lat = 38.9767231, zoom = 5) %>%
  addWMSTiles(
    "http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/nexrad/n0r.cgi",
    layers = "nexrad-n0r-900913", 
    options = WMSTileOptions(format = "image/png", transparent = TRUE),
    attribution = "Weather data Â© 2012 IEM Nexrad"
  )
map
```

Now that we have a map, let's save it by using the `saveWidget()`function.
`saveWidget()` will save your map to your working directory as a `.html` file.
~~~r
saveWidget(map, file="map.html")
~~~

Check where your map was saved by using the `getwd()` function which will show your working directory. If you would like to save your map somewhere more specific, you can specify the whole path before `map.html`. 
~~~r
saveWidget(map, file="/save/here/map.html")
~~~

You can now open `map.html` in your browser. `map.html` will open as a full screen html file.

To share your map, you can upload the `html` file to GitHub or any web server. 
We suggest you use GitHub and GitHub pages to share your map. 

Publishing your map via GitHub is simple: 
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Rename your `map.html` file to `index.html` and push this file to your repository. 
3. Go to your repository's settings and enable GitHub Pages. 
4. After a few minutes, your page will be ready to go and a link will be provided. 

Your map is now live. You can now share the link with your colleagues to share your map!

For more information about GitHub pages please see our lesson on [Advanced git Techniques](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/advanced-git-lesson/#/slides/pages). 
For information on getting started with GitHub check out our [Basic git](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/basic-git-lesson/) lesson.

If you prefer to embed your map inside a project, personal, or any other website you can do so by using the html `<iframe>` tag.

```html
<iframe src="map.html" frameborder="0" width="50%" height="200px"></iframe>
```
This is a good option when you already have a site built and would like to add your map to share it.

Web development is out of the scope of this lesson, but please check this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/html-iframes.php) out if you would like to learn more about using the `iframe` tag in your websites.
