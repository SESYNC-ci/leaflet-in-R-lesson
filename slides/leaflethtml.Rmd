## Publish a Leaflet map using HTML

If you prefer not to use Shinny, you can render a map using HTML!

```{r leaflet_html, handout = 4}}
library(leaflet)
rand_lng = function(n = 10) rnorm(n, -93.65, .01)
rand_lat = function(n = 10) rnorm(n, 42.0285, .01)
map = leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addCircles(rand_lng(50), rand_lat(50), radius = runif(50, 10, 200))

saveWidget(map, file="map.html")    # Save map as an html file
map

```

You can now open `map.htlm` in your browser. `map.html` will open as a full screen html file in your browser. 

You can upload the html file wherever you like and then iframe to it if you want to embed it into a website:
```html
iframe src="map.html" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300px"></iframe>
```
